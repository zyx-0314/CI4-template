# View -> Controller -> Routes

[ ] 1. Setup Environment
- [ ] Create project from template
- [ ] Clone to your local
- [ ] Make sure `Docker`, `php` and `composer` is installed to you pc. Your goof even you only using `Docker` but if youre orrotated in red lines install all
- [ ] (optional) If you have `php` and `composer` do this. After clone inside the `backend` folder use command 
```bash
composer install
```
- [ ] Start with updating `readme`
- [ ] Once all done you can start adding your `label` in your source control.
    - [ ] Since we updated the `readme`. since `readme` is document then we will automatically use `docs`
```bash
docs(readme): Updated the `readme`
```
- [ ] Start pushing directly to `main` or from a `branch` in `stagging`. Possible branch name `docs/readme`
- [ ] Once satisfied a `publish` or `sync` click it to push from `stagged` to the `remote`
- [ ] Create `Branch` name it `development` so you can safely develop without triggering auto checker


[ ] 2. Create your personal landing page
- [ ] Create `Issue` named Landing Page, can add description if you want to.
- [ ] Create `Branch` name it `frontend/landingPage`
- [ ] Add new `View` with basics html requirements under the `Views/user`
- [ ] Add new `Controller` named `Users` using command found on templates readme
    - [ ] Add `return view('user/landing');` inside `index()` to show the page
- [ ] Update `Routes.php` under `Config`
    - [ ] Update `Home::index` to `Users::index` reflecting the `User` Controller and `index` as one of its function
- [ ] Now visit your site for manual checking, [live](http://localhost:8090/).
    - This wont pose issue if you didnt change the port or the port is not in use
- [ ] Once all working you can start adding your `label` in your source control.
    - [ ] Since we created landing page view, controller and updated the routes. We could say we added a new feature
```bash
feat(landing page): Added a new landing page

- added new `view`
- added new `controller`
- updated routes to route the landing page
- deleted unecessary files
```
- [ ] Start `pushing` directly to the `branch` in `stagged`. If any changes is needed then add another `push`.
- [ ] Once satisfied a `publish` or `sync`, click it to push from `stagged` to the `remote`
- [ ] Once in `remote` you can create `PR` or `Pull Request`.
    - [ ] Make sure `PR` is from your completed branch which this time is `frontend/landingPage` and going to `development`
- [ ] Once `PR` is created if there is other member who need to review it you can set them to review and click `merge` if all goods, else you can comment and provide feedback.
